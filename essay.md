# Writing of the Essay

## Topic

Technological advancements have had more negative impacts on human
interaction and relationships than positive ones.

Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree
with the statement and explain you reasoning / or the position you take. In
developing and supporting you position, you should consider specific examples
of how technological advancements have affected human interaction and
relationships.

### Introduction

#### Hook (Generalization, anecdote, interesting fact, trend, quote, etc)

##### Introduces the topic (nothing more): don’t write your thesis or supporting idea here!

The past 20 years has engendered more human connectivity than all previous
millennia of our species' existence.

With SO much change in such a short period
of time, determining whether this phenomenon has been largely positive or
negative is difficult, if not impossible.

#### Shift to prompt

##### Makes your essay more cohesive(make it flow better); an abrupt shift to your thesis is awkward

The prompt takes the negative stance and
argues that technological advancements have resulted in more harm than good.

#### Thesis (most important part of the essay…by far)

##### This baby is the boss that controls everything

In my opinion,

##### The thesis you choose exists on a spectrum(strongly agree, mostly agree, neutral, mostly disagree, strongly disagree)

##### Greg recommends “mostly agree” or “mostly disagree”

I mostly disaguee with this view and believe that
technological progression has improved our connectivity and relationships

#### Outline (tells you reader how you’re going to structure your essay)

##### Don’t neglect this bad boy; academic readers like to know what’s coming(how many reasons/examples)

for the following two reasons, though I do concede that recent advancements
have unfortunately decreased our need for face-to-face connection.

### Body Paragraph 1

#### Topic sentence that introduces your first reason that supports your thesis

##### It is imperative that this introduces the overall idea of the paragraph (the “controlling” idea) and that it supports your thesis. The topic is a mini thesis

First of all. technological advancement has resulted in more benefits for our
interconnectivity because, as species, we are no longer constrained by
distance.

#### Example 1

##### You need a good example here, preferably from history, politics, economics etc

##### If you can’t think of one, use a good hypothetical

##### No one wants to hear about Uncle Bob

##### The example should be 1: epecific and 2: support your idea

For example, a Japanese 2 exchange student studying in New York City
can communicate with her mother in Tokyo easily and effectively at no charge
using an application like WhatsApp or Facebook.

#### Example 2 (Optional)

##### All the same rules apply

##### Why 2

###### Further develops the idea

###### Increases word count

###### Discourages “story telling”

##### Can be a 'counterexample' of the example before

In the past, this same student would 
have had no choice but to send a letter (which might arrive three weeks later)
or call long distance at an exorbitant rate of dollars per minute.

#### Development/Explanation

##### You need to develop your idea. You need to connect the reason to the thesis. You need to explain why this matters

##### 2-3 sentence of development is good enough

The Earth is massive, and even if one were traveling at the maximum speed of a
commercial jetliner, it would take nearly 24 hours to travel from end of the
planet to the other. However, technology, at least from a communication point
of view, has created a reality in which all of Earth's & billion inhabitants are
effectively right next to each other, not constrained by distance in any
meaningful way. The advantages of this leap cannot be overstated, from the way
we interact with our families to the way we conduct business around the globe.

#### Remember there are 2 of these!

### Body Paragraph 2

Second of all, the progression of our technology has allowed not just for the
ability to sustain our current relationships but also the capacity to form new
ones and become part of distinct communities. For example, an individual from
a small town in America might be partial to the roleplaying game Dungeons and
Dragons and be able to cultivate this hobby a by joining a local league in a larger
town that he discovered on the Internet. Thirty years ago, this individual would
have found it challenging to engage with this hobby and perhaps would never
have pursued it given the difficulty in locating likeminded peers. Humans have
an inherent need to be part of a tribe, to be part of a group that shares their
interests and passions. Technology makes this possible, particularly for those
individuals with niche hobbies that are not necessarily shared by those closest to
them. Such freedom of expression has led to millions of people thriving in life
and finding their true callings.

### Concession Paragraph (counterpoint)

#### Topic sentence that introduces a counterpoint to your thesis

##### Remember this is why we "mostly" agreed or disagreed. It leaves room for nuance

However, I do concede that technology has led to the unfortunate consequence
of people no longer feeling the need for face-to-face interaction.

#### Example

##### Same rules apply

For example,
especially after the Covid-19 pandemic, millions (perhaps billions) of workers
 around the globe no longer deem it necessary to go to their office and meet their
 co-workers on a personal level. Instead, they can simply use a video
conferencing app like Zoom or Google Meet.

#### (Optional) Example 2

##### Same rules apply here

In addition, the phenomenon of
"video dating" is becoming increasingly popular, where a date is conducted
entirely online rather than at a coffee shop or restaurant. 

#### Development / Explanation

##### Same rules apply again

As referenced above,
humans are extremely social animals. We have an instinctual need to be around
other humans. Multiple studies have shown that if a human is deprived of
contact with other members of the species, a host of physical and mental
consequences result. Technology, in some ways, is undermining this
evolutionary need, one that has been with us for hundreds of thousands of years.
It is possible that we can adjust to the new paradigm, but it's doubtful that this
adjustment can occur at the same rate of technological process. It is no surprise
that we are seeing rising depression and anxiety levels around the world, even
as our standards of living improve.

### Conclusion

#### Doesn't actually matter much. I mean you need it. It can't not exist. But all you want to do is rephrase your thesis and your supporting ideas and wrap this baby up.

In conclusion, while it is true that technological progress has eroded some of
our connectivity, particularly our face-to-face interaction, the benefits of instant
communication unrestricted by distance and forming connections with
likeminded people clearly outweigh the cons.
